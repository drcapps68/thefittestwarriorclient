      <p>The Bruce Lee Story</p>
      <p>From 1959 to 1963 Bruce Lee, James DeMile an undefeated Military Boxing Heavyweight Champion, Jesse Glover a Judo Practitioner, and Ed Hart a grappler fought, trained, and
        explored the strengths and weaknesses of Wing Chun, Boxing, Judo, Grappling, and the importance of speed training. They worked on different fight scenarios, reaction speed
        response, and attack strategies while developing a criteria to determine whether a technique met the standard of practicality, simplicity, and efficiency.</p>
      <p>It was during this period that the original foundations of Jeet Kune Do (JKD) were being laid. JKD is based on Bruce's philosophy, which at its core-is an individualâ€™s
        journey to ascertain what techniques work best for them based body type, athletics, personality, and training time.</p>
      <p>It was also during the Seattle period Bruce and James spent much time analyzing and the testing different types of striking methods out which came the famous one and
        three inch power punch. Later James DeMile would write the bestselling martial arts book called "Bruce Lee's 1 & 3 Inch Power Punch". The power punch striking technique
        became an immediate game changer in close quarter combat.</p>
